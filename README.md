# Spyfall game description:
Spyfall is a 2014 card game for 3–8 players designed by Alexandr Ushan and published by Hobby World. A sequel, Spyfall 2, was published in 2017. A superhero themed variant, DC Spyfall, was published in 2018.

A typical game of Spyfall lasts for about 10 minutes. All but one players receive a card showing the exact same location; the remaining player gets a "Spy" card. The spy has to guess the location, while other players have to identify the spy. Players ask one another questions, trying to lure the spy out without giving them too much information. At any time during the game, or at its end when the timer runs out, one player can accuse another one being a spy; if there is a consensus and a spy is identified, the spy loses; otherwise, the spy wins.

Spyfall was a 2016 Årets Spil Best Adult Game Winner. It was also nominated for the 2016 Spiel des Jahres award. Spyfall 2 was the runner up in the 2017 Best Party Game category for the BoardGameGeek award.
